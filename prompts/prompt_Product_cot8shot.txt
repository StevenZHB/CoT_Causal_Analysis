# Question:
What is the product of <<number1 such as 27>> and <<number2 such as 153>>?
# Reasoning:
Let's think step by step. <<number2 153 has three digits, so that we can reason in three steps.>>
1. <<Multiply number1 27 by the ones place digit 3 of number2 153>>
2. <<Multiply number1 27 by the tens place digit 50 of number2 153>>
<<other digits of number2 if it has>>
Answer:
Now, sum all the step results: <<sum of the results>>.
So, the final computed product is <<answer>>.

# Question:
What is the product of 21 and 20?
# Reasoning:
Let's think step by step.
1. Multiply 21 by 0 (the ones place digit of 20) = 0
2. Multiply 21 by 20 (the tens place digit of 20) = 420
Answer:
Now, sum all the step results: 0 + 420 = 420.
So, the final computed product is 420.

# Question:
What is the product of 955 and 273?
# Reasoning:
Let's think step by step.
1. Multiply 955 by 3 (the ones place digit of 273) = 2865
2. Multiply 955 by 70 (the tens place digit of 273) = 66850
3. Multiply 955 by 200 (the hundreds place digit of 273) = 191000
Answer:
Now, sum all the step results: 2865 + 66850 + 191000 = 260715.
So, the final computed product is 260715.

# Question:
What is the product of 357 and 720?
# Reasoning:
Let's think step by step.
1. Multiply 357 by 0 (the ones place digit of 720) = 0
2. Multiply 357 by 20 (the tens place digit of 720) = 7140
3. Multiply 357 by 700 (the hundreds place digit of 720) = 249900
Answer:
Now, sum all the step results: 0 + 7140 + 249900 = 257040.
So, the final computed product is 257040.
