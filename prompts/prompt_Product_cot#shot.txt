# Question:
What is the product of <<number1 such as 27>> and <<number2 such as 153>>?
# Reasoning:
Let's think step by step. <<number2 153 has three digits, so that we can reason in three steps.>>
1. <<Multiply number1 27 by the ones place digit 3 of number2 153>>
2. <<Multiply number1 27 by the tens place digit 50 of number2 153>>
<<other digits of number2 if it has>>
Answer:
Now, sum all the step results: <<sum of the results>>.
So, the final computed product is <<answer>>.
