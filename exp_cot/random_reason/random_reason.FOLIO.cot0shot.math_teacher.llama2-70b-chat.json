    "cot0shot.math teacher_output": "The correct option is: B) False\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The premise states that Robert Lewandowski is a striker, and strikers are soccer players. Therefore, Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player.\n2. The premise also states that Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen. According to the rule provided, if a player leaves a team, they no longer play for that team. Therefore, Robert Lewandowski no longer plays for Bayern Munchen.\n3. The question asks whether the statement \"Robert Lewandowski is a star\" is true, false, or uncertain.\n4. Being a star is not a characteristic of a soccer player, but rather a subjective opinion or label given to a player based on their performance, popularity, or other factors.\n5. Since Robert Lewandowski no longer plays for Bayern Munchen, it is uncertain whether he is still considered a star, as his current status as a soccer player is not provided in the context.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is B) False, as the statement \"Robert Lewandowski is a star\" cannot be definitively labeled as true or false based on the given information.",
