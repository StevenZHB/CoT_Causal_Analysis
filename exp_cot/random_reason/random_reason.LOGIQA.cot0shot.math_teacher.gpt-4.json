If the better the quality of original carpentry in a building, the less likely that building is to fall into disuse and be demolished, then it's possible that the reason why the guidebook writer observed superior carpentry in older hotels is not because the carpenters were more skilled, but because hotels with poor carpentry have been demolished. This would mean that the sample of hotels the guidebook writer is basing their argument on is biased, thus weakening their argument.\n\nOption B does not weaken the argument because it does not provide an alternative explanation for the observed difference in quality between older and newer hotels.\n\nOption C could potentially strengthen the argument, as it suggests that carpenters working after 1930 might have been less skilled due to shorter apprenticeships.\n\nOption D does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the difference in quality is not due to the materials used, which implies that it must be due to the skill, care, and effort of the carpenters, which is what the guidebook writer is arguing.\n\nThe correct option is: A.",

This indirectly undermines the climatologist's argument by showing that similar conditions in other regions have not led to the same outcomes predicted for the Rocky Mountains.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n"

This green fragrance can lure the natural enemies of pests to eliminate pests. Researchers use transgenic methods to introduce the gene of green pepper aroma synthesis enzyme into Arabidopsis thaliana of Cruciferae. Once the larvae of Pieris rapae eat the leaves, the fragrance of Arabidopsis thaliana will be enhanced, The parasitoid lays its eggs on the larvae of Pieris rapae, which can eat all the larvae before they form pupae. Therefore, the researchers conclude that if this research result is applied to the formula of vegetables, the use of pesticides can be greatly reduced\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, which of the following premises must be added in order to make the researcher's conclusion valid\n# Options:\nA) At present, pesticides used in vegetable cultivation are mainly used to eliminate pests\nB) Fragrance of transgenic vegetable leaves will be enhanced after injury\nC)  green fragrance of plants is their weapon of self-defense\nD) At present, china's current law allows the planting of genetically modified vegetables\n\n# Instruction:\n## Reasoning:",

Yet campaigning for elected office is extremely costly, and because only the wealthiest individuals are able to finance their own political campaigns, most candidates must seek funding from private sources. In so doing, the candidates are almost invariably obliged to compromise their principles.

Option B suggests that voters should not support candidates who accept private funding, but this also does not address the issue of campaign financing. Option C suggests that wealthy candidates should not be allowed to raise additional funds from private sources, but this does not address the issue of candidates who are not wealthy and therefore must rely on private funding.\n\nOption D, however, states that \"The government should finance a given activity if doing so will further a vested interest of society.\" This principle aligns with the argument made in the editorial, which is that the government should finance political campaigns because doing so would further a vested interest of society (i.e., maintaining a political system where candidates are free to adhere to their principles).
