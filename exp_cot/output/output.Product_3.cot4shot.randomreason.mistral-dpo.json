Here's how:\n\n| 4 | 9 | 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | 2 | 7 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 29 | 13 | 21 |\n\nFirst, we write the numbers being multiplied horizontally, with the rightmost digit at the top. Then, we write a vertical line to separate the numbers.\n\nNext, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (4) by each digit of the second number (6, 2, and 7). We write the results below the second number, aligning them with the corresponding digit.\n\nWe then carry over any digits that exceed the value of 9. For example, when we multiply 4 by 7, we get 28. Since the ones place is already filled, we carry over the 2 to the next column.\n\nWe continue this process for each digit of the first number, working from right to left.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products, including any carried over digits, to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, the answer is 29 times 6, plus 13 times 9, plus 21 times 7.

First, we broke down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the digits of the second number. Then, we multiplied the first number by each digit separately and added up the results. This allowed us to compute the product efficiently and accurately.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. 415 x 1 (ones place digit) = 0\n2. 415 x 8 (eights place digit) = 3280\n3. 415 x 5 (fives place digit) = 2075\n4. 415 x 2 (twos place digit) = 830\n5. 415 x 1 (ones place digit) = 415\n6. 415 x 6 (sixes place digit) = 2490\n7. 415 x 3 (threes place digit) = 1245\n8. 415 x 9 (nines place digit) = 3735\n9. 415 x 7 (sevens place digit) = 2899\n\nAdding up all the step results gives us the final product: 455653.",

Multiply 062 by 2 (the ones place digit of 603) = 8594\n5. Multiply 147 by 29 (the tens place digit of 542) = 77566\n9. Multiply 932 by 188 (the hundreds place digit of 061) = 38627\nAnswer:",
    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 8594 + 155024 + 77566 + 38627 = 138385.\nSo, the final computed product is 138385.\n\nIn summary, the product of 216 and 398 is 138385.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the long multiplication method. We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the first number (216) by the rightmost digit of the second number (398). This gives us the rightmost digit of the product. We then move to the next digit of the first number and repeat the process, carrying over any digits that exceed the current place value. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n216 x 398 =\n\n|   | 3 | 9 | 8 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|    | 8 | 28 | 46 |\n\nThe first row shows the second number (398) and the second row shows the first number (216) with each digit separated by vertical lines. We then multiply the first digit of the first number (2) by the rightmost digit of the second number (8) and write the result (16) below the corresponding vertical line. We then carry over the 6 (the result of multiplying the second digit of the first number by the rightmost digit of the second number) to the next place value. We repeat this process for each digit of the first number, carrying over any digits that exceed the current place value. The final result is the product.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!

Here's how:\n\n1. Write down the numbers with the rightmost digit (ones place) on the bottom row.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit, multiply the bottom number by the digit in the top number in the corresponding position. Write the result below the bottom number, aligned with the digit being multiplied.\n3. Add up the products of the corresponding digits in each column.\n4. Write the sum in the next column to the left.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all the digits in the top number have been used.\n\nHere's the long multiplication for this problem:\n\n124  x  912\n   |   \n   4   |   \n   8   |   \n   1   |   \n   2   |   \n   4   |   \n   ---+---\n   3   |   \n   8   |   \n  16  |   \n  32  |   \n  64  |   \n  128 |   \n   ---+---\n   0   |   \n   0   |   \n   0   |   \n   0   |   \n   0   |   \n   0   |   \n\nThe bottom row shows the partial products, and the top row shows the corresponding digit being multiplied. The final result is the sum of all the partial products.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n- 4 * 2 = 8\n- 8 * 4 = 32\n- 1 * 2 = 2\n- 2 * 4 = 8\n- 4 * 5 = 20\n- 1 * 5 = 5\n\nAdding up these partial products gives us the final result: 8 + 32 + 2 + 8 + 20 + 5 = 45.\n\nThe product of 124 and 912 is 117,408, and the long multiplication method helps us break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 9460 + 66866 - 133200 + 562144 = 424940.\nSo, the final computed product is 424940.\n\nIn summary, the product of 937 and 901 is 864030, the product of 335 and 212 is 706050, and the product of 486 and 067 is 316964. However, when computing the product of 937 and 901, we made a mistake by carrying over the 3 from the hundreds place to the thousands place, resulting in an incorrect answer. To correct this, we need to subtract the incorrect thousands place digit (3) from the final answer (424940) to get the correct answer (424600).\n\nSo, the final computed product is 424600.\n\nIn the other questions, the reasoning and answers are correct.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the product problem and how to solve it step by step.

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (3) with the rightmost digit of the first number (3). This gives us the rightmost digit of the product (9). We then move to the next digit of the second number (0) and repeat the process with the next digit of the first number (4). This gives us the second digit of the product (0). We continue this process for all the digits of the second number, keeping track of the carryover from each step.\n\nIn this case, we have two digits in the second number, so we need to perform two steps. The first step gives us a carryover of 2, which we add to the product of the next digit (2) and the first digit (6). This gives us the third digit of the product (8). We then add the carryover (2) to the product of the next digit (5) and the second digit (4). This gives us the fourth digit of the product (2).\n\nFinally, we add all the step results to get the full product.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the first number (1) by the rightmost digit of the second number (9). This gives us the rightmost digit of the product (9).\n\nNext, we move to the next digit of the first number (6) and multiply it by the rightmost digit of the second number (9). This gives us 54, which we carry over to the next digit of the product.\n\nWe then move to the next digit of the first number (1) and multiply it by the next digit of the second number (3). This gives us 3, which we add to the carried over 54 to get the next digit of the product (57).\n\nWe continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number by all the digits of the second number. The final product is the sum of all the partial products we have computed.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n- 1 * 9 = 9\n- 6 * 9 = 54 (carried over)\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n- 6 * 3 = 18 (carried over)\n- 1 * 7 = 7\n\nAdding these partial products together gives us the final product:\n\n- 9\n- 57\n- 18\n- 702\n\nTotal: 766\n\nHowever, we can simplify this process by grouping the digits of the second number and multiplying them in threes. This is called the \"chunking\" method, and it can make multiplication much faster and easier.\n\nIn this case, we can chunk the second number (220) into three groups: 200, 20, and 0. We then multiply each group by the corresponding digit of the first number (361).\n\n- 3 * 200 = 600\n- 6 * 20 = 120\n- 1 * 0 = 0\n\nAdding these partial products together gives us the same final product:\n\n- 600\n- 120\n- 0\n\nTotal: 720\n\nThis method is faster because we only have to do three multiplications instead of nine. It's also easier because we don't have to carry over as many digits.\n\nIn summary, the product of 361 and 220 is 720, and we can use the chunking method to make multiplication faster and easier.",

Starting with the rightmost digit of the second number, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the first number and write the result below:\n\n   | 3 | 2 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   | 7 | 4 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   |    | 20 | 25 |\n\n3. Multiply the next digit of the second number by the first number's rightmost digit and write the result below:\n\n   | 3 | 2 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   | 7 | 4 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   |    | 20 | 25 |\n   | 300 | --- | --- |\n\n4. Add the products of the corresponding digits:\n\n   | 3 | 2 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   | 7 | 4 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   |    | 20 | 25 |\n   | 300 | --- | --- |\n   | --- | 1200 | 1500 |\n\n5. Write the result above the multiplication table:\n\n   | 3 | 2 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   | 7 | 4 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   |    | 20 | 25 |\n   | 300 | --- | --- |\n   | --- | 1200 | 1500 |\n   | 4025 | --- | --- |\n\n6. The final result is the number at the bottom right corner:\n\n   | 3 | 2 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   | 7 | 4 | 5 |\n   | --- | --- | --- |\n   |    | 20 | 25 |\n   | 300 | --- | --- |\n   | --- | 1200 | 1500 |\n   | 4025 | --- | --- |\n\nSo, the product of 325 and 745 is 4025.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 2746 + 201337 = 228783.\nSo, the final computed product is 228783.\n\nIn summary, the product of 901 and 238 is 228783.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the standard algorithm for multi-digit numbers. We start by multiplying the rightmost digit (5) of the second number (005) with the leftmost digit (1) of the first number (901). This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit (0) of the second number and multiply it with the leftmost digit of the first number. This gives us 0. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number with the leftmost digit of the first number.\n\nNext, we move to the leftmost digit of the second number (3) and multiply it with the leftmost digit of the first number (9). This gives us 2725. We then move to the next digit (7) of the second number and multiply it with the leftmost digit of the first number. This gives us 64250. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number with the leftmost digit of the first number.\n\nFinally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n- 5 (from multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number with the leftmost digit of the first number)\n- 0\n- 2725 (from multiplying the second digit of the second number with the leftmost digit of the first number)\n- 64250 (from multiplying the third digit of the second number with the leftmost digit of the first number)\n\nAdding up these partial products gives us the final answer of 228783.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 7436 + 646572 + 324737 = 423725.\nSo, the final computed product is 423725.\n\nIn summary, the product of 1039 and 727 is 423725.\n\nTo solve this problem, we followed a step-by-step reasoning process. First, we broke down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the digits of the second number. Then, we multiplied the first number by each digit separately and added up the results. This allowed us to compute the product efficiently and accurately.\n\nIn the first step, we multiplied the ones place digit (3) of the second number (727) by the first number (1039). This gave us a result of 3118.\n\nIn the second step, we multiplied the tens place digit (270) of the second number by the first number. This gave us a result of 2839300.\n\nIn the third step, we multiplied the hundreds place digit (7) of the second number by the first number. This gave us a result of 7253000.\n\nWe then added up all the step results to get the final computed product of 423725.\n\nThis process can be applied to any multiplication problem, regardless of the size of the numbers involved. By breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps, we can make the computation more manageable and less prone to errors.",

We multiplied the first number by each digit separately and added up the results to get the final product.\n\nThis method is called long multiplication, and it can be helpful for larger numbers that are difficult to multiply mentally or using a calculator.

We multiplied the first number by the ones place digit (3) and the tens place digit (50) of the second number, and then added up the results to get the final product.\n\nIn the second example, we found the product of 21 and 20 using a simpler process, since both numbers have only two digits. We multiplied the first number by the ones place digit (0) and the tens place digit (20) separately and added up the results.\n\nIn the third example, we found the product of 955 and 273 using the same long multiplication process as in the first example.

We multiplied the first number by the ones place digit (4) and the tens place digit (10) separately and added up the results.\n\nBy following these steps and breaking down the problem into smaller parts, we can better understand the process of multiplication and avoid making mistakes.

Here's how:\n\n5 | 5 | 5\n- | - | -\n9 | 7 | 1\n------\n45 | 35 | 5\n\nFirst, we write the numbers being multiplied horizontally, with the rightmost digit at the bottom.

We write the results below the corresponding digit of the second number.\n\nFor example, we multiply 5 by 1 to get 5, which we write below the 1 in the second number.\n\nWe then move to the next digit of the second number (7) and repeat the process. We multiply 5 by 7 to get 35, which we write below the 7.\n\nFinally, we add up the products of each digit to get the total product. In this case, the total product is 450, which we write below the vertical line.\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we can also use the place value system to help us remember which digit to multiply. In this case, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (5) by the rightmost digit of the second number (1), which is in the ones place. We then move to the next digit of the second number (7) and multiply it by the rightmost digit of the first number (5), which is in the tens place.\n\nBy following this process, we can calculate the product of any two numbers using the long multiplication method.",

Here's how:\n\n6 | 6 | 6\n- | - | -\n3 | 3 | 3\n--- | --- | ---\n2 | 1 | 0\n4 | 4 | 4\n\nFirst, we write the numbers being multiplied horizontally, with the larger number on the left. Then, we write a vertical line to separate the numbers. Next, we write the smaller number below the larger number, with the ones place digit on the right.\n\nTo find the product, we multiply the rightmost digit of the smaller number (3) by each digit of the larger number (6) and write the results below the corresponding digit. We then carry over any digits that exceed the ones place.\n\nWe repeat this process for each digit of the smaller number, working from right to left. Finally, we add up all the products to get the total.\n\nIn this case, the products are:\n\n216 (6 * 34)\n672 (6 * 112)\n2016 (6 * 338)\n\nAdding these products together gives us the final answer: 7835926.",

First, we broke down the multiplication into smaller steps, multiplying the ones place digit, the tens place digit, and the hundreds place digit separately. Then, we added up all the step results to get the final product. This method helps us to better understand the multiplication process and avoid making mistakes.\n\nIn the first example, we multiplied 27 by the ones place digit 3 of 153, which gave us 0. Then, we multiplied 27 by the tens place digit 50 of 153, which gave us 1395. So, the final product is 1395.\n\nIn the second example, we multiplied 21 by the ones place digit 0 of 20, which gave us 0. Then, we multiplied 21 by the tens place digit 20 of 20, which gave us 420. So, the final product is 420.\n\nIn the third example, we multiplied 955 by the ones place digit 3 of 273, which gave us 2865. Then, we multiplied 955 by the tens place digit 70 of 273, which gave us 66850. Finally, we multiplied 955 by the hundreds place digit 200 of 273, which gave us 191000. So, the final product is 260715.\n\nIn the fourth example, we multiplied 357 by the ones place digit 0 of 720, which gave us 0. Then, we multiplied 357 by the tens place digit 20 of 720, which gave us 7140. Finally, we multiplied 357 by the hundreds place digit 700 of 720, which gave us 249900. So, the final product is 257040.\n\nIn the fifth example, we multiplied 87 by the ones place digit 4 of 14, which gave us 348. Then, we multiplied 87 by the tens place digit 10 of 14, which gave us 870. So, the final product is 1218.\n\nIn the sixth example, we multiplied 548 by the ones place digit 9 of 607, which gave us 5. Then, we multiplied 433 by the ones place digit 4 of 590, which gave us 1732. Then, we multiplied 402 by the ones place digit 3 of 095, which gave us 6271. Finally, we multiplied 609 by the hundreds place digit 236 of 558, which gave us 639051. So, the final product is 652770.\n\nBy following this step-by-step reasoning process, we can better understand the multiplication process and avoid making mistakes.

However, since we're multiplying two-digit numbers, we need to carry the 9 from the second step to the next digit:\n- 9 * 1 = 9 (fourth step)\n- 0 * 140 = 0 (fifth step)\n\nNow, we can add up the results: 84 + 9 + 0 = 93. This is the same result we got using the step-by-step method.\n\nSo, the final computed product is 930.\n\nIn summary, we can use the shortcut method for multiplying two-digit numbers by a one-digit number, but we need to be careful with carrying over digits when multiplying two-digit numbers.",

We multiplied the first number (764) by each digit in the second number (548) and added up the results. This allowed us to see the individual contributions of each digit in the second number to the final product.\n\nIn the first step, we multiplied the ones place digit (4) of the second number by the first number. Since the ones place digit is always 0 in a three-digit number, the result was 0.\n\nIn the second step, we multiplied the tens place digit (50) of the second number by the first number. This gave us a result of 38200.\n\nIn the third step, we multiplied the hundreds place digit (8) of the second number by the first number. This gave us a result of 614400.\n\nWe then added up all the results to get the final product.\n\nThis method of breaking down a multiplication into smaller steps is called partial products or long multiplication.

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 1151 + 53748 = 54909.\nSo, the final computed product is 54909.\n\nIn summary, the product of 340 and 166 is 54909.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the standard algorithm for multi-digit multiplication. We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 2) by the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 3). This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit of the second number (which is 4) and repeat the process. We continue this until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number.\n\nNext, we add up all the partial products we have obtained. The final result is the product of the two numbers.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n- 3 * 2 = 6\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n- 3 * 6 = 18\n- 3 * 0 = 0\n\nWe then add up these partial products to get the final product: 6 + 12 + 18 = 36.\n\nHowever, since we want to follow the given template, we will break down the multiplication into smaller steps to make it more clear and understandable.\n\n1.

Multiply 340 by 6 (the hundreds place digit of 166) = 0\n\nNow, sum all the step results: 0 + 680 + 1360 = 2040.\n\nSo, the final computed product is 2040.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this process by realizing that the hundreds place digit of the second number is 0, which means that the hundreds place digit of the product will also be 0. Therefore, we can skip step 4 and go directly to step 5.\n\n5. Multiply 859 by 8 (the ones place digit of 412) = 6872\n6.

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 4) by the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 4). This gives us the rightmost digit of the product. We then move to the next digit of the second number (which is 1) and repeat the process, multiplying it by the leftmost digit of the first number and adding the result to the previous partial product. We continue this process for all the digits of the second number, adding the partial products as we go.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n414 x 142 = (4 x 4) + (1 x 40) + (4 x 1) + (1 x 400) = 16 + 400 + 4 + 400 = 890\n\nI hope that helps clarify the reasoning behind the solution!

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 329 + 160 + 691383 = 693122.\nSo, the final computed product is 693122.\n\nIn summary, the product of 171 and 271 is 467 times 185, which is 825 times 8, plus 329, plus 160.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the distributive property to break down the multiplication into smaller multiplications. Here's how:\n\n171 x 271 = 171 x (100 x 2 + 7)\n                 = 100 x 171 x 2 + 171 x 7\n                 = 200200 + 1218\n\nAlternatively, we can also use long multiplication, which involves writing out the numbers horizontally and multiplying each digit by the corresponding digit in the other number.

We do the same for the next digit (4) and the next digit (5).\n\nNext, we move to the next column to the left. We multiply the rightmost digit of the smaller number (3) by the corresponding digit in the larger number (8) and write down the result below. We do the same for the next digit (4) and the next digit (5).\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost column and multiply the rightmost digit of the smaller number (9) by the corresponding digit in the larger number (1). We do the same for the next digit (2) and the next digit (0).\n\nAfter filling in all the columns, we add up the results in each column to get the final product.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the process!

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 8 + 7156 + 965256 = 983110.\nSo, the final computed product is 983110.\n\nIn summary, the product of 592 and 990 is 983110.\n\nTo solve this problem, we followed the same reasoning process as in the previous examples. We multiplied the ones place digit, tens place digit, and hundreds place digit of the second number separately and then added the results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the ones place digit (3) of the second number (383) by the first number (592). This gives us 1776.\n\n2. Multiply the tens place digit (8) of the second number (841) by the first number (592). This gives us 4736.\n\n3. Multiply the hundreds place digit (5) of the second number (588) by the first number (592). This gives us 346400.\n\n4. Multiply the thousands place digit (2) of the second number (588) by the first number (592). This gives us 0.\n\n5.

This gives us 0.\n\nNow, sum all the step results: 1776 + 4736 + 346400 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3691040.\n\nSo, the final computed product is 3691040.\n\nHowever, since the second number is actually 990, we need to adjust the result by subtracting the last two digits (03) from the result.\n\n965256 - 3691040 = 983110.\n\nTherefore, the product of 592 and 990 is 983110.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 8 + 0 + 180135 = 180141.\nSo, the final computed product is 180141.\n\nIn summary, the product of 980 and 403 is 180141.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the standard algorithm for multi-digit numbers. We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 3) with the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 9). This gives us 27, which we add to the product of the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 8) and the second digit of the second number (which is 0). We continue this process for each digit of the second number, multiplying it with the corresponding digit of the first number and adding the results.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n980 x 403 =\n\n(9 x 3) + (8 x 0) = 27\n\n(9 x 0) + (8 x 3) + (0 x 0) = 24\n\n(9 x 0) + (8 x 0) + (5 x 6) = 240\n\n(9 x 0) + (8 x 0) + (5 x 0) + (6 x 3) = 180\n\n(9 x 0) + (8 x 0) + (5 x 0) + (6 x 0) + (0 x 9) + (3 x 5) + (1 x 1) = 180141\n\nI hope this helps clarify the process!

However, let's say we made a mistake in our calculations and ended up with the incorrect answer. By following the steps and reasoning provided, we can identify and correct our errors.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the product of 174 and 374 should have been 64216, but we ended up with a much larger number. This indicates that we may have made a mistake in one or more of our multiplication steps.\n\nLet's take a closer look at our calculations:\n\n1. 174 x 3 = 522\n2. 174 x 7 = 1218\n3. 174 x 9 = 1566\n4. 174 x 10 = 1740\n5. 174 x 11 = 1914\n6. 174 x 12 = 2092\n7. 174 x 92 = 16148\n8. 174 x 101 = 17694\n\nAs we can see, there are a few errors in our calculations. In step 3, we should have multiplied by 9, not 8. In step 7, we should have multiplied by 92, not 921. These errors resulted in incorrect results for steps 4 and 8, which in turn led to an incorrect final product.\n\nBy identifying and correcting these errors, we can arrive at the correct product of 174 and 374.\n\nIn general, when solving multiplication problems, it's important to double-check our calculations and ensure that we're following the correct steps.

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 2) by the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 7). This gives us 14, which we write in the bottom right corner of the multiplication table.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit of the second number (which is 6) and multiply it by the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 7). This gives us 42, which we write in the bottom left corner of the multiplication table.\n\nWe continue this process for each digit of the second number, filling in the multiplication table as we go. Once we have multiplied all the digits, we add up the results in the bottom row to get the final product.\n\nIn this case, the product is quite large, so we may need to carry over some digits as we multiply. This is why we have a column for carrying over digits, which we use to keep track of any extra digits that need to be added to the result.\n\nBy following this algorithmic process, we can accurately calculate the product of any two numbers, no matter how large they may be.",

Here's how:\n\n790  x  543\n------------------\n   074  x  61\n   467  x  6\n   0   x  322\n------------------\n\nFirst, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (3) with the leftmost digit of the first number (7). We write the result (21) below the line and align it with the digit we multiplied.\n\nNext, we move one place to the left and repeat the process. This time, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (2) with the second digit of the first number (9). We write the result (18) below the line and align it with the digit we multiplied.\n\nWe continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number with the corresponding digits of the first number.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products we obtained. The sum is the product of the two numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n7 x 5 = 35\n9 x 3 = 27\n0 x 2 = 0\n\nWe add up the results: 35 + 27 + 0 = 62.\n\nNow, we move one place to the left and repeat the process:\n\n7 x 4 = 28\n9 x 5 = 45\n0 x 1 = 0\n\nWe add up the results: 28 + 45 + 0 = 73.\n\nNext, we move one place to the left and repeat the process:\n\n7 x 3 = 21\n9 x 0 = 0\n\nWe add up the results: 21 + 0 = 21.\n\nFinally, we move one place to the left and repeat the process:\n\n7 x 2 = 14\n9 x 0 = 0\n\nWe add up the results: 14 + 0 = 14.\n\nNow, we add up all the products we obtained: 62 + 73 + 21 + 14 = 441915.\n\nThis is the product of 790 and 543.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 1 + 3079 + 521382 = 524362.\nSo, the final computed product is 524362.\n\nIn summary, the product of 440 and 714 is 524362.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the long multiplication method. Here's how:\n\n440 x 714\n\n| 4 | 4 | 0 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 | 1 | 4 |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 28 | 29 | 56 |\n\nFirst, we write the numbers being multiplied horizontally, with the larger number on the left. Then, we write the smaller number below the larger number, with the ones place digit on the right.\n\nNext, we multiply the rightmost digit of the smaller number (which is 4) by each digit of the larger number, starting from the right. We write the results below the smaller number, aligning them with the corresponding digit of the larger number.\n\nFor example, we multiply 4 x 4 (which is 16) and write it below the 4 in the smaller number. We also multiply 4 x 0 (which is 0) and write it below the 0 in the smaller number.\n\nWe then move to the next digit of the smaller number (which is 1) and repeat the process. We multiply 1 x 4 (which is 4) and write it below the 4 in the larger number. We also multiply 1 x 0 (which is 0) and write it below the 0 in the larger number.\n\nWe continue this process for all the digits of the smaller number, until we have multiplied it by all the digits of the larger number.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products to get the total product. In this case, the total product is 28 (from the ones place digit) + 29 (from the tens place digit) + 56 (from the hundreds place digit) = 113.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the long multiplication method!

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) by the leftmost digit of the first number (191). This gives us the rightmost digit of the product. We then move to the next digit of the second number (6) and repeat the process, carrying over any digits that exceed the value of 9. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n1. 191 * 5 = 955\n2. 191 * 6 = 1146\n3. 191 * 3 = 573\n4. 191 * 9 = 1719\n5. 191 * 0 = 0\n\nAdding up these partial products gives us the final product of 20177.",

Here's how:\n\n916 x 971 = (9 x 1) + (16 x 9) + (6 x 7) + (484 x 148)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The ones place digit of 971 is 1, so we multiply the ones place digit of 916 (6) and get 6.\n\n2. The tens place digit of 971 is 9, so we multiply the tens place digit of 916 (16) and get 144.\n\n3. The hundreds place digit of 971 is 6, so we multiply the hundreds place digit of 916 (484) and get 2904.\n\n4. Now, we add all the results: 6 + 144 + 2904 = 3054.\n\nSo, the final computed product is 3054.

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the first number (6) by the rightmost digit of the second number (2). We then move one digit to the left and repeat the process. We continue this until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number by all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n640 x 272 = 1744 x 2 + 1600 x 2 + 640 x 10 + 320 x 50 + 160 x 200\n\nWhen we expand this expression, we get:\n\n1744 x 2 = 3488\n1600 x 2 = 3200\n640 x 10 = 6400\n320 x 50 = 160000\n160 x 200 = 320000\n\nAdding up all the partial products, we get the final answer: 471034.",

First, we broke down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the digits of the second number. Then, we multiplied the first number by each digit separately and added up the results. This allowed us to compute the product efficiently and accurately.\n\nIn the first step, we multiplied the ones place digit of the second number (2) with the first number (775). This gave us 1550, which is the product of the ones place digit and the first number.\n\nIn the second step, we multiplied the tens place digit of the second number (93) with the first number (775). This gave us 742250, which is the product of the tens place digit and the first number.\n\nIn the third step, we multiplied the hundreds place digit of the second number (260) with the first number (775). This gave us 2025000, which is the product of the hundreds place digit and the first number.\n\nFinally, we added up all the step results to get the total product. This method is called partial products or digit-by-digit multiplication, and it is a useful technique for multiplying large numbers efficiently.",

Multiply 148 by 2 (the ones place digit of 951) = 9016\n0. Multiply 053 by 994 (the tens place digit of 788) = 080683\nAnswer:",
    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 9016 + 080683 = 891849.\nSo, the final computed product is 891849.\n\nIn summary, the product of 866 and 169 is 891849.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the standard algorithm for multi-digit multiplication. We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 9) by the leftmost digit of the first number (8). We then move to the next digit of the second number (5) and repeat the process. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, the partial products are:\n\n- 866 * 9 = 7894\n- 866 * 5 = 4330\n- 866 * 1 = 866\n\nWe then add up these partial products to get the final answer:\n\n- 7894 + 4330 + 866 = 891849\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!

We continue this until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number by all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n8 * 1 = 8\n4 * 1 = 4\n2 * 1 = 2\n\n1 * 4 = 4\n1 * 5 = 5\n1 * 1 = 1\n\n5 * 4 = 20\n5 * 5 = 25\n5 * 1 = 5\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n3 * 5 = 15\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nAdding up all the partial products, we get:\n\n8 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 20 + 25 + 15 + 3 = 59\n\nThis is our final answer, but we can simplify it by grouping the digits in threes:\n\n596 = 5 * 10^3 + 9 * 10^2\n\nSo, our final answer is 59672.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 3681 + 214239 + 753035 = 994715.\nSo, the final computed product is 994715.\n\nIn summary, the product of 217 and 729 is 994715.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the long multiplication method. Here's how:\n\n1. Write down the numbers vertically, with the rightmost digit at the top.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number, and write down the results below.\n3. Add up the results in each column to get the final product.\n\nHere's the long multiplication for 217 x 729:\n\n```\n  7 2 9\n x 2 1 7\n------\n  0   0  0\n  0   0 162\n14642\n```\n\nIn the first row, we write down the second number (729) vertically.\n\nIn the second row, we write down the first number (217) horizontally, and then multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the second number, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nFor example, the first digit of the second number is 9, so we multiply it by the first digit of the first number (2) to get 18. We write down the result (8) below, because the result is less than 100.\n\nWe continue this process for all the digits, and then add up the results in each column to get the final product.\n\nIn this case, the final product is 14642, which is the same as the result we got using the reasoning method.",

Multiply 390 by 5 (the ones place digit of 222) = 4\n9. Multiply 594 by 75 (the tens place digit of 324) = 41909\n2. Multiply 069 by 8152 (the hundreds place digit of 241) = 7108736\nAnswer:",
    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 4 + 41909 + 7108736 = 7109249.\nSo, the final computed product is 7109249.\n\nIn summary, the product of 716 and 400 is 7109249.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the long multiplication method. Here's how:\n\n716 x 400\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 7 | 1 | 6 |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   | 4 | 0 | 0 |   |   |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 28 | 64 | 24 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nThe first step is to align the decimal points of both numbers. Since 716 does not have a decimal point, we leave it as it is. The decimal point of 400 is three places to the right, so we add three zeros to the right of 716.\n\nNext, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the rightmost digit of the second number (0). Since the result is zero, we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nWe then multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (1) by the rightmost digit of the second number (0). Again, the result is zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nNow, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (6) by the rightmost digit of the second number (0). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the fourth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the second digit of the second number (4). The result is 28, which we write in the third row.\n\nIn the fifth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (1) by the second digit of the second number (0). The result is zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the sixth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (6) by the second digit of the second number (0). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the seventh column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (0). The result is zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the eighth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (2). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the ninth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (4). The result is zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the tenth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (0). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the eleventh column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (5). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the twelfth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (2). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the thirteenth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (4). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the fourteenth column, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (0) by the third digit of the second number (0). The result is still zero, so we write it in the bottom row and move to the next column.\n\nIn the fifteenth column",

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 4) by the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 2). We then move one digit to the left and repeat the process. We continue this until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. We then add up all the products to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n287 x 654 = 1884 x 5 (rightmost digit of 654) + 18840 x 6 (second digit of 654) + 188400 x 4 (third digit of 654) + 0 (fourth digit of 654)\n\nI hope that helps!

This gives us 48, which we write in the bottom right corner of the multiplication table.\n\nNext, we move to the leftmost digit of the first number (which is 6) and multiply it by the rightmost digit of the second number (which is 1). This gives us 64, which we write in the bottom left corner of the multiplication table.\n\nWe continue this process, moving leftward through the digits of the first number and multiplying each digit by the rightmost digit of the second number. We then move up to the next digit of the second number and repeat the process.\n\nIn this case, we have to repeat this process twice, since the second number has two digits. After completing all the multiplications, we add up the results to get the final product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the process! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 7 + 820 + 868151 = 877378.\nSo, the final computed product is 877378.\n\nIn summary, the product of 701 and 900 is 877378.\n\nTo solve this problem, we followed a step-by-step reasoning process. First, we broke down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the place value of each digit. Then, we multiplied the numbers in each step and added up the results to get the final product.\n\nIn step 1, we multiplied the ones place digit of 900 (which is 0) with 701. Since the result is always 0 when multiplying a number with 0, we skipped this step.\n\nIn step 2, we multiplied the tens place digit of 900 (which is 4) with 701. This gave us 2804.\n\nIn step 3, we multiplied the hundreds place digit of 900 (which is 6) with 701. This gave us 420600.\n\nIn step 4, we multiplied the thousands place digit of 900 (which is 9) with 701. This gave us 630900.\n\nIn step 5, we multiplied the ten thousands place digit of 900 (which is 0) with 701. Since the result is always 0 when multiplying a number with 0, we skipped this step.\n\nIn step 6, we multiplied the hundred thousands place digit of 900 (which is 4) with 701. This gave us 280400.\n\nIn step 7, we multiplied the millions place digit of 900 (which is 0) with 701. Since the result is always 0 when multiplying a number with 0, we skipped this step.\n\nIn step 8, we multiplied the ten millions place digit of 900 (which is 9) with 701. This gave us 6309000.\n\nIn step 9, we multiplied the hundred millions place digit of 900 (which is 0) with 701. Since the result is always 0 when multiplying a number with 0, we skipped this step.\n\nIn step 10, we multiplied the billion place digit of 900 (which is 4) with 701. This gave us 280400000.\n\nFinally, we added up all the step results to get the final product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the reasoning process behind solving multiplication problems using place value.

We start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the first number (3) by the rightmost digit of the second number (5). We then move one place to the left and repeat the process. We continue this until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number by all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the total product.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n355 x 375 = (3 x 5) + (3 x 70) + (3 x 3) + (35 x 5) + (35 x 70) + (350 x 3)\n\nThe first partial product is 15 (3 x 5). The second partial product is 210 (3 x 70). The third partial product is 105 (3 x 35). The fourth partial product is 175 (35 x 5). The fifth partial product is 2475 (35 x 70).

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 6208 + 58625 + 063854 = 1269708.\nSo, the final computed product is 1269708.\n\nIn summary, the product of 641 and 549 is 1269708.\n\nTo solve this problem, we followed a step-by-step reasoning process, breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the place value of each digit. This allowed us to manage the large numbers and avoid errors in computation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the ones place digit (6) of the first number (641) by the ones place digit (3) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the ones place digits, which is 18.\n\n2. Multiply the ones place digit (6) of the first number (641) by the tens place digit (4) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the ones place digit and the tens place digit, which is 246.\n\n3. Multiply the ones place digit (6) of the first number (641) by the hundreds place digit (5) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the ones place digit and the hundreds place digit, which is 30.\n\n4. Multiply the tens place digit (4) of the first number (641) by the ones place digit (9) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the tens place digit and the ones place digit, which is 36.\n\n5. Multiply the tens place digit (4) of the first number (641) by the tens place digit (4) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the tens place digit and the tens place digit, which is 160.\n\n6. Multiply the tens place digit (4) of the first number (641) by the hundreds place digit (3) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the tens place digit and the hundreds place digit, which is 120.\n\n7. Multiply the hundreds place digit (5) of the first number (641) by the ones place digit (9) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the hundreds place digit and the ones place digit, which is 45.\n\n8. Multiply the hundreds place digit (5) of the first number (641) by the tens place digit (4) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the hundreds place digit and the tens place digit, which is 200.\n\n9. Multiply the hundreds place digit (5) of the first number (641) by the hundreds place digit (5) of the second number (549). This gives us the product of the hundreds place digit and the hundreds place digit, which is 2500.\n\n10. Sum all the step results to get the final product.\n\nBy breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps, we were able to manage the large numbers and avoid errors in computation. This technique is especially useful when dealing with multi-digit numbers, as it allows us to focus on one digit at a time and avoid mistakes in carrying over digits.",

    "cot4shot.randomreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 7970 + 02853 + 860032 = 988285.\nSo, the final computed product is 988285.\n\nIn summary, the product of 686 and 924 is 988285.\n\nTo solve this problem, we used the distributive property to break down the multiplication into smaller steps. We multiplied the first number (686) by each digit in the second number (924) and added up the results. This allowed us to see the individual contributions of each digit in the second number to the final product.\n\nIn the first step, we multiplied the ones place digit (4) of the second number by the first number. Since the ones place digit is always 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, we know that the result will always be less than or equal to 36.\n\nIn the second step, we multiplied the tens place digit (50) of the second number by the first number. Since the tens place digit is always 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, we know that the result will always be less than or equal to 360.\n\nIn the third step, we multiplied the hundreds place digit (8) of the second number by the first number. Since the hundreds place digit is always 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, we know that the result will always be less than or equal to 5120.\n\nBy breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps, we can see the individual contributions of each digit in the second number to the final product. This can help us to better understand the multiplication process and to identify any errors in our calculations.\n\nIn the given template, we followed a similar process to solve each multiplication problem. By breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps, we were able to compute the product accurately and efficiently.",
