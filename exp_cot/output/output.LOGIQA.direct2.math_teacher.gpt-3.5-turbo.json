This green fragrance can lure the natural enemies of pests to eliminate pests. Researchers use transgenic methods to introduce the gene of green pepper aroma synthesis enzyme into Arabidopsis thaliana of Cruciferae. Once the larvae of Pieris rapae eat the leaves, the fragrance of Arabidopsis thaliana will be enhanced, The parasitoid lays its eggs on the larvae of Pieris rapae, which can eat all the larvae before they form pupae. Therefore, the researchers conclude that if this research result is applied to the formula of vegetables, the use of pesticides can be greatly reduced\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, which of the following premises must be added in order to make the researcher's conclusion valid\n# Options:\nA) At present, pesticides used in vegetable cultivation are mainly used to eliminate pests\nB) Fragrance of transgenic vegetable leaves will be enhanced after injury\nC)  green fragrance of plants is their weapon of self-defense\nD) At present, china's current law allows the planting of genetically modified vegetables\n\n# Instruction:\n## Answer:",

Some researchers believe that this formation can reduce air resistance and flight energy consumption, but opponents believe that if it is to reduce resistance, birds should choose a straight line formation, because one flight after another can minimize the air resistance that followers need to overcome.\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, if which of the following is true, which of the following options most questions the opponent's conclusion?\n# Options:\nA) During the flight, the leading geese will change positions with their rear companions from time to time, otherwise they will easily be exhausted.\nB) When flying, the spotted geese deviate from their companions in front of them, which can not minimize the air resistance, but can greatly reduce the physical energy consumption required for ascent.\nC) Spotted geese will have the need to determine the direction when flying, so they will not always fly in the shape of human.\nD) In speed skating competitions, athletes often advance in the shape of people. one athlete is in the front, followed by three others, and the last three players benefit from reduced resistance.\n\n# Instruction:\n## Answer:",

At the more trivial end, orthodox medicine is largely ineffective in treating aches, pains, and allergies, and, at the other extreme, it has yet to produce a cure for serious, life-threatening diseases such as advanced cancer and lupus.

Without these bees, many crops related to human life would not exist, such as soybeans, cotton, apricots, sunflowers and so on. Almost 1/3 of the world's food is related to the behavior of bees. If they become extinct, it will be followed by serious social problems such as serious food shortages, hunger, violence and riots.\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, which of the following options cannot be inferred from the original text?\n# Options:\nA) Queen bees are more resistant to colony collapse syndrome than worker bees.\nB) The syndrome of colony collapse in the united states is earlier than that in europe.\nC) Colony collapse syndrome can lead to serious social problems.\nD) Lack of food is the main reason for the disappearance of worker bees.\n\n# Instruction:\n## Answer:",

The per capita GDP in Somalia rose from $210 in 1991 to $600 in 2011. In the same year, per capita GDP was US $548 in Tanzania, US $436 in Central Africa and US $350 in Ethiopia.In view of this, compared with many African countries ruled by a strong central government, Somalia, which is in a state of anarchy, its people's living standards are not poor at all.\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, which of the followings accurately summarizes the most serious flaw in the above argument?\n# Options:\nA) The wealth of somalia is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, and many people fall into poverty because of factors such as security or unemployment.\nB) The increase in per capita gdp benefits from somali pirates hijacking merchant ships and looting the property of other countries.\nC) The increase in per capita gdp in somalia is due to the fact that economic freedom is contained in anarchy.\nD) It is unreliable to judge the overall living standard of the people of a country on the basis of a single index.\n\n# Instruction:\n## Answer:",

Given a context and a question, directly answer with the format \"The correct option is: A/B/C/D\" without any other information.\n####\n# Context:\nPlantings of cotton bioengineered to produce its own insecticide against bollworms, a major cause of crop failure, sustained little bollworm damage until this year. This year the plantings are being seriously damaged by bollworms. Bollworms, however, are not necessarily developing resistance to the cotton' s insecticide. Bollworms breed on corn, and last year more corn than usual was planted throughout cotton-growing regions. So it is likely that the cotton is simply being overwhelmed by corn-bred bollworms.\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, in evaluating the argument, which of the following would it be most useful to establish?\n# Options:\nA) Whether plantings of cotton that does not produce the insecticide are suffering unusually extensive damage from bollworms this year\nB) Whether corn could be bioengineered to produce the insecticide\nC) Whether there are insecticides that can be used against bollworms that have developed resistance to the insecticide produced by the bioengineered cotton\nD) Whether plantings of bioengineered cotton are frequently damaged by insect pests other than bollworms\n\n# Instruction:\n## Answer:",
