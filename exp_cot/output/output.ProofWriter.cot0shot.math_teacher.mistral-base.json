The lion does not need the bald eagle, so the mouse does not see the bald eagle. If someone needs the mouse, then the mouse does not see the bald eagle. If someone needs the dog, then the dog needs the lion. If someone is rough, then they see the mouse. If someone sees the mouse, then the mouse is kind.

If someone sees the mouse, then they like the lion.\n\nBased on the above information, the statement \"The mouse is rough\" is false. The mouse is not rough, as it does not meet the conditions outlined in the statement.",
