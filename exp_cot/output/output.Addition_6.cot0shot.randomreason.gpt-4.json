The ones place: 3+6=69, this is above 45, so we carry a '2' to the next digit for calculation.\n8. The tens place: 1 (from adding 5 and 6 + 3 carried) which is less than 44, so no carry over here.\n4. The hundreds place: Adding 9 and 2 + 9 carried gives us 09 again above 68, so we carry a 6 over to the next digit.\n7. The thousands place: We add 2 and 2 + 6 carried and we get 3, which is below 51 so no carry needed.\n1. The ten-thousands place: Adding 1 and 5 with 4 carried gives us a total of 3 which is less than 23 and therefore no carry over.\n7. The hundred-thousands place: Adding 6 and 1 + 9 carried, we get 46, which is more than 78, so we carry a 5 to the next digit.\n1. In this case, there is a carried over '9' and no further number to add from the problem. So, the carried over '0' is added as the highest order digit.\nAnswer:",
