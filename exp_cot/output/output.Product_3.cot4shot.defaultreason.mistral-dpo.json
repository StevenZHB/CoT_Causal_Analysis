In this process, we multiply each digit of the first number (477) by each digit of the second number (263) and add up the results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the rightmost digit of the second number (3). This gives us 21, which we write below the second number.\n\n2. Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the second digit of the second number (6). This gives us 42, which we write below the second digit.\n\n3. Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the third digit of the second number (0). This gives us 0, which we write below the third digit.\n\n4.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 8) with the first number (163) and write the result below the first number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (0) and continue until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nIn this case, the first step is to multiply 163 by 8, which gives us 1264. The second step is to multiply 163 by 800, which gives us 130880. We then add up these two products to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the process of long multiplication! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

    "cot4shot.defaultreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 6544 + 818000 = 823544.\nSo, the final computed product is 823544.\n\nIn summary, the product of 818 and 818 is 823544.\n\nTo calculate this product, we can follow a step-by-step process called long multiplication. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Write the first number (818) at the top of the page, and the second number (818) below it.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit of the second number, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the first number, and write the results below the second number.\n3. Add up the results in each column to get the final product.\n\nHere's what the long multiplication looks like for this problem:\n\n```\n818\n------\n818\n```\n\nFirst, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (8) by the corresponding digit in the first number (8). This gives us 64.\n\nNext, we multiply the next digit (1) by the corresponding digit in the first number (8). This gives us 81.\n\nFinally, we multiply the leftmost digit (8) by the corresponding digit in the first number (8). This gives us 6464.\n\nAdding up the results in each column, we get the final product: 823544.\n\nLong multiplication can be a bit tedious, but it's a useful skill to have, especially when working with large numbers. With practice, you'll be able to calculate products like this one quickly and accurately.",

    "cot4shot.defaultreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 2943 + 882900 = 885843.\nSo, the final computed product is 885843.\n\nIn summary, the product of 981 and 193 is 885843.\n\nTo calculate this product, we follow the steps of long multiplication. First, we multiply the ones place digit of the second number (3) with the first number (981). This gives us the first digit of the product. Next, we multiply the tens place digit of the second number (90) with the first number. This gives us a large number, which we write as a three-digit number with a comma separating the hundreds and thousands places. Finally, we add the results of both steps to get the complete product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how to solve multi-digit multiplication problems using long multiplication.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 1) by the first number (178) to get the ones place digit of the product. Then, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (6) by the first number (178) to get the tens place digit of the product. Finally, we multiply the hundreds place digit of the second number (600) by the first number (178) to get the hundreds place digit of the product. We then add up all the step results to get the final product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the process for you! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 3) with the first number (442) and write the result below the second number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (20) and continue until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nIn the given example, the first step is to multiply 3 with the ones place digit (2) of the first number (442). This gives us 6. We write this product below the second number, aligned with the digit we multiplied.\n\nNext, we multiply the tens place digit (0) of the second number (203) with the first number (442). This gives us 0. We write this product below the second number, aligned with the digit we multiplied.\n\nWe then move on to the hundreds place digit (2) of the second number (203). We multiply this digit with the first number (442) and write the result below the second number. This gives us 992.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process of long multiplication better.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) with the first number (487) and write the result below the line. We then repeat this process for the next digit (200) and the next digit (900) until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the products to get the final answer.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication process:\n\n```\n487\n  |\n925\n  |\n  500\n  ------\n  2435\n  ------\n  974000\n  ------\n  440500\n  ------\n  1018935\n```\n\nIn the first row, we write down the number we are multiplying (487).\n\nIn the second row, we write down the number we are multiplying by (925).\n\nIn the third row, we write down the products of the rightmost digit of the second number (5) with each digit of the first number (4, 8, 7).\n\nIn the fourth row, we write down the products of the next digit of the second number (200) with each digit of the first number.\n\nIn the fifth row, we write down the products of the next digit of the second number (900) with each digit of the first number.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the process of long multiplication!

In this process, we multiply each digit of the first number (817) by each digit of the second number (183) and add up the results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the rightmost digit of the second number (3).

Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (1) by the second digit of the second number (8). This gives us 81, which we write below the second number with a line connecting it to the correct place value.\n\n3. Multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (7) by the third digit of the second number (0). This gives us 0, which we write below the second number with a line connecting it to the correct place value.\n\n4. Add up the results from step 1, 2, and 3 to get the total for the ones place.\n\n5.

The result is 8, which we write below the second number.\n\nIn the second step, we multiply the rightmost digit (1) of the second number with the first number. The result is 414, which we write below the first number.\n\nIn the third step, we multiply the second digit (4) of the second number with the first number. The result is 165600, which we write below the first number.\n\nIn the fourth step, we subtract the corresponding products from the second number to avoid double counting.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process better!

In this process, we multiply the first digit of the first number (1) by each digit of the second number (2, 7, and 1) and add the results. We then move to the next digit of the first number (7) and repeat the process. This continues until we have multiplied all the digits of the first number by all the digits of the second number.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the long multiplication process for 171 x 271:\n\n171 x 1 = 171\n171 x 2 = 342\n171 x 7 = 1201\n\nAdding the results, we get:\n\n171 x 271 = 171 + 342 + 1201 = 124831\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!

    "cot4shot.defaultreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 0 + 795600 = 795600.\nSo, the final computed product is 795600.\n\nIn summary, the product of 994 and 801 is 795600.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the distributive property to break down the multiplication into smaller multiplications. Since 801 has three digits, we can think of it as 800 (the hundreds, tens, and ones place digits) and 1 (the ones place digit). We start by multiplying the ones place digit (1) with the first number (994). This gives us 0, since the ones place digit of 801 is 1, which is less than 10. Next, we multiply the hundreds, tens, and thousands place digits (800) with the first number (994). This gives us a large number, which we can calculate by multiplying the hundreds place digit (8) with the first number (994), then multiplying the result with 100, and finally adding the result of multiplying the tens place digit (0) with the first number (994) and the result of multiplying the ones place digit (0) with the first number (994).\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how to solve multiplication problems with three-digit numbers!

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 7) with the first number (359) to get the first digit of the product. We then multiply the second digit of the second number (100) with the first number to get the next few digits of the product. Finally, we multiply the third digit of the second number (400) with the first number to get the remaining digits of the product. We then add up all the partial products to get the final product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process better! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 9) with the first number (196) to get the ones place digit of the product. Then, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (6) with the first number (196) to get the tens place digit of the product. We continue this process for all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the complete product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process better. Let me know if you have any further questions!",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 6) with the first number (662) and then move to the next digit of the second number (50) and repeat the process. We keep doing this until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number.

Next, we multiplied the tens place digit (50) of the second number with the first number. This gave us a large number, which we carried over to the next step.

In this case, we can think of 384 as 400 - 16, and then multiply 402 by each part separately. This allows us to avoid multiplying large numbers directly and makes the calculation easier to manage.\n\nHere's how the reasoning might look like:\n\n1. Multiply 402 by 4 (the ones place digit of 384) = 1608\n2. Multiply 402 by 400 (the thousands place digit of 384) = 1608000\n3. Multiply 402 by -16 (the sign of the subtraction) = -64368\n\nNow, sum all the step results: 1608 + 1608000 - 64368 = 12401928.\n\nThis method is called partial products, and it's a useful technique for multiplying large numbers by hand or on a calculator. By breaking down the multiplication into smaller steps, we can avoid errors and make the calculation more manageable.",

Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication process:\n\n```\n767\n  |\n4 8 8\n------\n6136\n460200\n3068000\n```\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process for you!

Here's how it works:\n\n1. Write the numbers vertically, with the rightmost digit of the bottom number (640) on the bottom line and the rightmost digit of the top number (272) on the top line.\n\n2. Starting with the rightmost digit of the top number, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the bottom number, and write the results below the corresponding digit in the bottom number.\n\n3.

Continue this process for all the digits in the top number.\n\n6. Add up all the sums to get the final product.\n\nHere's an example of how to calculate 640 x 272 using long multiplication:\n\n```\n6 4 0\n  x 2 7 2\n----------------\n   1 4 4 0\n  1 6 6 4 0\n----------------\n 1 9 6 1 6 0\n```\n\nIn this example, we start by writing the numbers vertically, with the rightmost digit of the bottom number (6) on the bottom line and the rightmost digit of the top number (2) on the top line.\n\nNext, we multiply the rightmost digit of the top number (2) by the corresponding digit in the bottom number (6), and write the result (12) below the corresponding digit in the bottom number (6).\n\nWe repeat this process for each digit in the top number, adding up the results for each digit in the bottom number as we go.\n\nFinally, we add up all the sums to get the final product (1961600).\n\nIn the given template, the product of 640 and 272 is calculated using a similar process, but with larger numbers.

We started by multiplying the ones place digit of the second number (3) with the first number (775). This gave us the first digit of our product. Next, we multiplied the tens place digit of the second number (80) with the first number (775). This gave us a large number, which we carried over to the next step. In the final step, we multiplied the hundreds place digit of the second number (800) with the first number (775). We added up all the results from each step to get the final product.\n\nThis process can be applied to any multiplication problem, regardless of the size of the numbers involved. It may take some practice to get comfortable with long multiplication, but with time and patience, it becomes a useful tool for solving complex math problems.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (8 in this case) with the first number (359) to get the ones place digit of the product. Then, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (2) with the first number (359) and add a zero to the right of it to get the tens place digit of the product. Finally, we multiply the remaining digits of the second number (0 and 8) with the first number and add them to the previous results to get the full product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process better!

Here's how it works:\n\n1. Write the multiplicand (674) on the left and the multiplier (310) on the right.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit of the multiplier, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the multiplicand, placing the results below the multiplicand.\n3. Add up the results in each column to get the final product.\n\nLet's walk through an example:\n\n6  | 7  | 4  |\n--- | --- | --- |\n3  | 1  | 0  |\n--- | --- | --- |\n20  | 21  | 0  |\n\nFirst, we multiply the rightmost digit of the multiplier (0) by each digit in the multiplicand:\n\n0 * 6 = 0\n0 * 7 = 0\n0 * 4 = 0\n\nNext, we move to the next digit in the multiplier (1) and repeat the process:\n\n1 * 6 = 6\n1 * 7 = 7\n1 * 4 = 4\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit in the multiplier (3) and repeat the process:\n\n3 * 6 = 18\n3 * 7 = 21\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow we add up the results in each column to get the final product:\n\n| Column | Results |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ones | 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 = 12 |\n| Tens | 0 + 0 + 6 + 21 = 27 |\n| Hundreds | 0 + 0 + 0 + 18 = 18 |\n\nSo the final product is 1827.\n\nIn the given template, the students are asked to solve similar problems using this step-by-step process.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 1) by each digit of the first number (8, 4, and 2) and add the results to get the corresponding digit in the product. We then move to the next digit in the second number and repeat the process.\n\nIn this case, since the ones place digit of 141 is 1, we start by multiplying each digit of 842 by 1 and adding the results. Since the result is always 0, we skip this step.\n\nNext, we move to the tens place digit of 141, which is 40. We multiply each digit of 842 by 40 and add the results. This gives us 33680.\n\nFinally, we move to the hundreds place digit of 141, which is 100. We multiply each digit of 842 by 100 and add the results. This gives us 84200.\n\nWe then add up all the results to get the final product, which is 87560.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) with the first number (401) and write the result below the first number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (6) and so on. Finally, we add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nIn the given example, the first step involves multiplying 5 with the ones place digit (1) of the first number (401). The second step involves multiplying 60 (the tens place digit of the second number) with the first number. The third step involves multiplying 500 (the hundreds place digit of the second number) with the first number. We then add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process of long multiplication better.

In this process, we multiply the first digit of the first number (7) by each digit of the second number (194) and add the results.

This time, we multiply the first digit of the first number (7) by the tens place digit of the second number (1) and the hundreds place digit of the second number (9).

First, we multiplied the ones place digit of the second number (8) with the first number (651). Then, we multiplied the tens place digit of the second number (30) with the first number. Finally, we multiplied the hundreds place digit of the second number (300) with the first number. We added up all the results to get the final product.\n\nThis method is called the partial products method, and it helps us to break down a multiplication problem into smaller, more manageable steps. It's especially useful for multi-digit numbers, as it allows us to avoid carrying over digits and makes the calculation process more efficient.",
