If there are other digits in 54, let's say there are 2 digits, so we multiply 32 by 2 more digits, which are 4 and 2.\n\nSo, the step-by-step calculation is:\n\n1. 32 x 4 = 128\n2. 32 x 50 = 1600\n3. 32 x 4 = 128\n4. 32 x 2 = 64\n\nNow, let's sum all the step results: 128 + 1600 + 128 + 64 = 1970.\n\nTherefore, the final product of 32 and 54 is 1970.",
