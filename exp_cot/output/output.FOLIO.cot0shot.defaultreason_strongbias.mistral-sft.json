Since we know that all rabbits are cute, and we know that all squirrels are skittish, we can eliminate the possibility that rock is a rabbit or a squirrel. Therefore, we can say that \"Rock is a turtle\" is false.\n\n9. We can then look at the second part of the statement, \"or cute\".

    "cot0shot.defaultreason_strongbias_output": "The correct option is: B/C\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reason through the given context and question.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant information:\n- If people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n- All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home.\n- All people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n- All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n- If people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n- Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nNow, let's reason through the question:\n\nThe question asks if the statement \"Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly\" is true, false, or uncertain.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the relevant information. We know that if people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home. We also know that all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home. Therefore, if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then they work regularly and often at home.\n\nWe also know that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly. Therefore, if Remy works regularly and often at home, then they visit the office supply store regularly.\n\nHowever, we do not know if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office. Therefore, we cannot say for certain if the statement \"Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly\" is true or false. We can only say that it is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: B/C.",

Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting. Michael cannot block Windy's shooting. Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.\n\n# Question:\nBased on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peter can block Windy's shooting.\n# Options:\nA) True\nB) False\nC) Uncertain\n\n# Instruction:\nI think the correct option is: B\n## Reasoning:\nThe correct option is: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Peter can block Windy's shooting\" is false. This is because Peter is taller than Michael, who is taller than everyone else in his class. However, the text also states that Michael cannot block Windy's shooting. Therefore, Peter cannot block Windy's shooting either.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the statement is false.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the statement is either true or false, not uncertain.\nThe correct option is:",
