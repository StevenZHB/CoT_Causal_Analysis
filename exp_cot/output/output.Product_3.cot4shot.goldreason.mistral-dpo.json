In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 8) with the first number (487), then we move to the next digit (7) and repeat the process. We continue this process until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nHere's an example of how the long multiplication process would look like for this problem:\n\n```\n487 \n   | 178\n------\n   0 \n34090 \n   | 700\n------\n   0 \n389600 \n   | 1000\n------\n   0 \n8629600 \n```\n\nIn the first row, we write down the first number (487) as it is. In the second row, we write down the second number (178) below the first number. In the third row, we start multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (8) with the first number (487). We write down the result (3896) below the corresponding digit in the second row. We continue this process for the next digit (7) and repeat it for all the digits in the second number. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the final answer.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the long multiplication process better!

In this case, we can think of multiplying the hundreds, tens, and ones place digits of the second number (518) separately.\n\nFirst, we multiply the ones place digit (8) of the second number by the first number (629). This gives us 5032.\n\nNext, we multiply the tens place digit (10) of the second number by the first number. This gives us 6290.\n\nFinally, we multiply the hundreds place digit (500) of the second number by the first number. This gives us 314500.\n\nWe then add up all the smaller products to get the final answer.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the reasoning behind the solution!

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 4) with the first number (622) and write the result below the second number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (10) and continue until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number. Finally, we add up all the products obtained in each step to get the final answer.\n\nIn the given example, the first step is to multiply 4 with the ones place digit (2) of the first number (622). This gives us 8. We then move to the next digit (0) and repeat the process. The second step is to multiply 4 with the tens place digit (6) of the first number, which gives us 24. We then move to the next digit (2) and repeat the process again. The third step is to multiply 4 with the hundreds place digit (0) of the first number, which gives us 0. We then move to the next digit (6) and repeat the process again. The fourth step is to multiply 4 with the thousands place digit (2) of the first number, which gives us 8. We then move to the next digit (0) and repeat the process again. The fifth step is to multiply 4 with the ten thousands place digit (6) of the first number, which gives us 24. We then move to the next digit (2) and repeat the process again. The sixth step is to multiply 4 with the hundred thousands place digit (0) of the first number, which gives us 0. We then move to the next digit (6) and repeat the process again. The seventh step is to multiply 4 with the million place digit (2) of the first number, which gives us 8. We then move to the next digit (0) and repeat the process again. The eighth step is to multiply 4 with the ten million place digit (6) of the first number, which gives us 24. We then move to the next digit (2) and repeat the process again. The ninth step is to multiply 4 with the hundred million place digit (0) of the first number, which gives us 0. We then move to the next digit (6) and repeat the process again. The tenth step is to multiply 4 with the billion place digit (2) of the first number, which gives us 8. We then move to the next digit (0) and repeat the process again. The eleventh step is to multiply 4 with the ten billion place digit (6) of the first number, which gives us 24. We then move to the next digit (2) and repeat the process again. The twelfth step is to multiply 4 with the hundred billion place digit (0) of the first number, which gives us 0. We then move to the next digit (6) and repeat the process again. The thirteenth step is to multiply 4 with the trillion place digit (2) of the first number, which gives us 8. We then move to the next digit (0) and repeat the process again. The fourteenth step is to multiply 4 with the ten trillion place digit (6) of the first number, which gives us 24. We then move to the next digit (2) and repeat the process again. The fifteenth step is to multiply 4 with the hundred trillion place digit (0) of the first number, which gives us 0. We then move to the next digit (6) and repeat the process again. The sixteenth step is to multiply 4 with the thousand trillion place digit (2) of the first number, which gives us 8.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) with the first number (571) and write the result below the second number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (70) and the hundreds digit (200). We add up the results to get the final product.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication:\n\n571\n  ~~~\n275\n    ~~~\n      50000\n     - 25000\n     ------------------\n      25000\n\nThe first line shows the first number, 571. The second line shows the second number, 275, with lines drawn underneath each digit. The third line shows the results of multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (5) with each digit of the first number. The fourth line shows the results of multiplying the next digit (70) with each digit of the first number. The fifth line shows the results of multiplying the hundreds digit (200) with each digit of the first number. We then add up the results to get the final product, which is shown in the bottom line.\n\nIn this case, the bottom line shows a difference of -25000, which is due to the fact that we're carrying over a digit from the previous line. We can ignore this difference and focus on the final product, which is 25000.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process of long multiplication! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Here's how it works:\n\n1. Write the multiplicand (the number being multiplied) on the left and the multiplier (the number being multiplied by) on the right.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit of the multiplier, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the multiplicand, starting from the rightmost digit of the multiplicand.\n3. Write the product of each digit pair below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand.\n4. Add up the products to get the final result.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n274 | 560\n--- | ---\n   | 600\n   | 500\n   | 400\n   | 300\n   | 200\n   | 100\n   | 0\n\nThe first row is just a placeholder to align the numbers. The second row is where we start multiplying.\n\nFor the second row, we multiply the rightmost digit of the multiplier (0) by each digit in the multiplicand (2, 7, 4) and write the results below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand. Since the rightmost digit of the multiplier is 0, all the products in this row are 0.\n\nFor the third row, we multiply the next digit of the multiplier (6) by each digit in the multiplicand and write the results below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand.\n\nFor the fourth row, we multiply the next digit of the multiplier (5) by each digit in the multiplicand and write the results below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand.\n\nWe continue this process for all the digits in the multiplier.\n\nFinally, we add up all the products to get the final result. In this case, the sum of all the products is 153440, which is the product of 274 and 560.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "cot4shot.goldreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 936 + 56160 + 280800 = 339840.\nSo, the final computed product is 339840.\n\nIn summary, the product of 936 and 361 is 339840.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the distributive property to break down the multiplication into smaller multiplications. In this case, we can think of 361 as 100 times 3 (the hundreds place digit) plus 60 times 6 (the tens place digit) plus 1 times 1 (the ones place digit).\n\nHere's how the reasoning might look like:\n\n1. Multiply 936 by 1 (the ones place digit of 361) = 936\n2. Multiply 936 by 100 (the hundreds place digit of 361) = 93600\n3. Multiply 936 by 600 (the hundreds place digit of 361) = 561600\n\nNow, sum all the step results: 936 + 93600 + 561600 = 651000.\n\nSo, the final computed product is 651000.\n\nHowever, since we know that 361 is less than 1000, we can use the shortcut method to avoid carrying out the multiplication of the hundreds place digit. Instead, we can multiply the hundreds place digit directly by the number, and then add the products of the ones and tens place digits.\n\nHere's how the reasoning might look like:\n\n1.

Instead, we can multiply the hundreds place digit directly by the number, and then add the products of the ones and tens place digits.

Finally, we add up all the results to get the final product.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication process:\n\n```\n981\n  ~\n193\n  3 \n  9 \n  0 \n  1 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0",

    "cot4shot.goldreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 5312 + 53120 + 531200 = 587424.\nSo, the final computed product is 587424.\n\nIn summary, the product of 664 and 888 is 587424.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the distributive property to break down the multiplication into smaller multiplications. In this case, we can think of 888 as 800 (the hundreds place digit) + 80 (the tens place digit) + 8 (the ones place digit). We then multiply each digit separately and add up the results.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Multiply 664 by 8 (the ones place digit of 888): 664 * 8 = 5312\n2. Multiply 664 by 80 (the tens place digit of 888): 664 * 80 = 53120\n3. Multiply 664 by 800 (the hundreds place digit of 888): 664 * 800 = 531200\n4.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 8) with the first number (463) and write the result below the first number. We then repeat this process for the next digit (60) and the hundreds digit (100). We add up the results to get the final product.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication:\n\n```\n463\n  |\n168 \n  ----\n   800\n  3456\n```\n\nThe first line shows the first number, 463. The second line shows the second number, 168, with vertical lines separating the digits. The third line shows the results of multiplying the rightmost digit of the second number (8) with each digit of the first number. The fourth line shows the results of multiplying the next digit (60) with each digit of the first number. The fifth line shows the results of multiplying the hundreds digit (100) with each digit of the first number.

In this process, we multiply the first digit of the first number (6) by each digit of the second number (1, 2, and 1) and add the results. We then move to the next digit of the first number (9) and repeat the process. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the total product.\n\nHere's an example of how we might write out the long multiplication for this problem:\n\n6      9       2\n1   2   1\n------\n12   18   2\n\nThe first line shows the two numbers we're multiplying. The second line shows the second number (121) written out with a vertical line separating each digit. The third line shows the first number (692) written out with a vertical line separating each digit.\n\nTo find the product, we start by multiplying the first digit of the first number (6) by the first digit of the second number (1). We write the result (6) below the first digit of the second number and line up the second digit of the second number (2) to the right of it. We then multiply the first digit of the first number (6) by the second digit of the second number (2) and write the result (12) below the second digit of the second number. We continue this process for each digit of the second number, adding up the partial products as we go.\n\nIn this case, we get the following partial products:\n\n12   18   2\n1   2   1\n------\n12   18   2\n\nWe then add up the partial products to get the total product:\n\n12 * 1 = 12\n18 * 1 = 18\n2 * 1 = 2\n\nAdding these partial products together gives us the total product: 32.\n\nSo, the product of 692 and 121 is 83232.",

    "cot4shot.goldreason_output": "Now, sum all the step results: 1568 + 17920 + 179200 = 198224.\nSo, the final computed product is 198224.\n\nIn summary, the product of 224 and 887 is 198224.\n\nTo find the product, we can follow a step-by-step process called long multiplication. In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 7) with each digit of the first number (in this case, 224) and add the results. We then move to the next digit of the second number (in this case, 80) and repeat the process. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication process:\n\n```\n       887\n    ________\n224  |   2   |\n      |  22  |\n      | 484  |\n      |19616  |\n      |------|\n      |198224 |\n```\n\nIn the first row, we write down the second number (887) vertically.\n\nIn the second row, we write down the first number (224) horizontally.\n\nIn the third row, we multiply the rightmost digit (7) of the second number with each digit of the first number and write down the results below the corresponding digit of the first number.\n\nIn the fourth row, we add up the partial products from the third row to get the full product.\n\nThe final result is 198224.",

First, we break down the multiplication into smaller steps based on the digits of the second number. In this case, we have three digits, so we multiply the first number by the ones place digit, the tens place digit, and the hundreds place digit of the second number. We then add up the results to get the final product.\n\nIn the first step, we multiply the ones place digit of the second number (8) by the first number (911). This gives us 7288. In the second step, we multiply the tens place digit of the second number (0) by the first number (911). Since the tens place digit is zero, this step gives us zero. In the third step, we multiply the hundreds place digit of the second number (300) by the first number (911). This gives us 273300. We then add up all the step results to get the final product.\n\nBy following these steps, we can efficiently and accurately compute the product of two numbers, even if they have multiple digits.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) with each digit of the first number (in this case, 531) and add the results to get the final product.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the rightmost digit (5) of the second number (265) with the rightmost digit (1) of the first number (531). This gives us 5.\n\n2. Multiply the rightmost digit (5) of the second number (265) with the second digit (3) of the first number (531). This gives us 15.\n\n3. Multiply the rightmost digit (5) of the second number (265) with the third digit (1) of the first number (531). This gives us 5.\n\n4. Add all the results from step 1, 2, and 3 to get the final product for the ones place.\n\n5. Move to the next place value (tens) and repeat the process with the second digit (3) of the first number (531).\n\n6. Multiply the second digit (3) of the first number (531) with the rightmost digit (0) of the second number (265). This gives us 0.\n\n7. Multiply the second digit (3) of the first number (531) with the second digit (6) of the second number (265). This gives us 180.\n\n8. Add all the results from step 6 and 7 to get the final product for the tens place.\n\n9. Move to the next place value (hundreds) and repeat the process with the third digit (1) of the first number (531).\n\n10. Multiply the third digit (1) of the first number (531) with the rightmost digit (0) of the second number (265). This gives us 0.\n\n11.

Since 701 has three digits, we can think of it as 700 (the hundreds place digit) and 1 (the ones place digit). We start by multiplying the ones place digit (1) with the first number (390), which gives us 390. Then, we multiply the ones place digit (1) with the second number (390), which gives us 0 because the ones place digit is 0. Finally, we multiply the hundreds place digit (700) with the first number (390), which gives us a large number (273000). We add up all the smaller multiplications to get the final product.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the reasoning behind the steps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (641) by the rightmost digit of the second number (1) to get the rightmost digit of the product. We then multiply the rightmost digit of the first number by the second digit of the second number (30) to get the next digit of the product, and so on. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product.\n\nIn the given example, the partial products are:\n\n641 * 1 = 641 (rightmost digit)\n641 * 30 = 19230 (next digit)\n641 * 400 = 256400 (hundreds digit)\n\nAdding up these partial products gives us the final product of 272271.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 1) by each digit of the first number (in this case, 4, 2, and 5) and add the results. We then move to the next digit of the second number (in this case, 30) and repeat the process. Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the long multiplication:\n\n```\n425    |   131\n------+------\n   1   |   425\n   30  |  13250\n   100 | 42500\n------------------\n   570 | 57025\n```\n\nIn the first row, we write down the first number (425) and the second number (131) separated by a vertical line.\n\nIn the second row, we write down the rightmost digit (1) of the second number and multiply it by each digit of the first number. We then write down the partial products below the corresponding digits.\n\nIn the third row, we repeat the process for the next digit of the second number (30).\n\nFinally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product (57025).\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!

Here's how it works:\n\n1. Write the multiplicand (the number being multiplied) on the left and the multiplier (the number being multiplied by) on the right.\n2. Starting from the rightmost digit of the multiplier, multiply each digit by the corresponding digit in the multiplicand, starting from the rightmost digit of the multiplicand.\n3.

Write the sum as the corresponding digit in the product.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each digit in the multiplier.\n7. Add up all the digits in the product to get the final answer.\n\nIn the case of 176 and 122, we would write it out like this:\n\n|  1   |  7   |  6   |\n|------|-------|------|\n|  2   |  0   |  2   |\n|------|-------|------|\n|  2   |  0   |  0   |\n|------|-------|------|\n|  2   |  0   |  0   |\n|------|-------|------|\n|  1   |  0   |  0   |\n|------|-------|------|\n\nThe first row is the multiplicand (176). The second row is the multiplier (122). The third row is the partial products, which are the results of multiplying each digit in the multiplier by the corresponding digit in the multiplicand. The fourth row is the final product, which is the sum of all the partial products.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the second number (in this case, 5) with the first number (861) and write the result below the line. We then repeat this process for the next digit (60) and the next digit (900) until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number.

In the second row, we write down the second number (965) and draw a line to separate it from the first number. We then start multiplying the rightmost digit (5) of the second number with each digit of the first number, starting from the rightmost digit. We write the results below the line, aligning them with the corresponding digit of the first number. We repeat this process for the next digit (60) and the next digit (900) until we have multiplied all the digits of the second number.

In this process, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number (406) by the rightmost digit of the second number (3) to get the rightmost digit of the product. We then multiply the rightmost digit of the first number by the second digit of the second number (40 times 0) to get the second digit from the right of the product. Next, we multiply the rightmost digit of the first number by the third digit of the second number (40 times 40) to get the third digit from the right of the product. We then add up all the digits we have obtained so far to get the final product.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the process of long multiplication better.

Finally, we add up all the partial products to get the full product.\n\nHere's an example of how we might write out the long multiplication for this problem:\n\n9     3     6\n---    ---    ---\n1     2    1\n\n(1) is the ones place digit of 121, (2) is the tens place digit, and (1) is the hundreds place digit.\n\n9 x 1 = 9\n9 x 2 = 18\n9 x 6 = 54\n\nAdding the partial products:\n9 + 18 + 54 = 71\n\nSo, the product of 936 and 1 is 936.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit of the first number (3) and repeat the process:\n\n3     3     6\n---    ---    ---\n1     2    1\n\n3 x 1 = 3\n3 x 2 = 6\n3 x 6 = 18\n\nAdding the partial products:\n3 + 6 + 18 = 27\n\nSo, the product of 936 and 3 is 27.\n\nFinally, we add the partial products from both steps:\n\n71 + 27 = 98\n\nSo, the product of 936 and 121 is 98.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the process!
