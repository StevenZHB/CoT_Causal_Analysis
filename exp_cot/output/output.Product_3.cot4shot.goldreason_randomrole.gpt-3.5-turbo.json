Multiply 21 by 0 (the ones place digit of 20) = 0\n2. Multiply 21 by 20 (the tens place digit of 20) = 420\nAnswer:\nNow, sum all the step results: 0 + 420 = 420.\nSo, the final computed product is 420.\n####\n# Question:\nWhat is the product of 955 and 273?\n# Reasoning:\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Multiply 955 by 3 (the ones place digit of 273) = 2865\n2. Multiply 955 by 70 (the tens place digit of 273) = 66850\n3. Multiply 955 by 200 (the hundreds place digit of 273) = 191000\nAnswer:\nNow, sum all the step results: 2865 + 66850 + 191000 = 260715.\nSo, the final computed product is 260715.\n####\n# Question:\nWhat is the product of 357 and 720?\n# Reasoning:\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Multiply 357 by 0 (the ones place digit of 720) = 0\n2. Multiply 357 by 20 (the tens place digit of 720) = 7140\n3. Multiply 357 by 700 (the hundreds place digit of 720) = 249900\nAnswer:\nNow, sum all the step results: 0 + 7140 + 249900 = 257040.\nSo, the final computed product is 257040.\n####\n# Question:\nWhat is the product of 87 and 14?\n# Reasoning:\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Multiply 87 by 4 (the ones place digit of 14) = 348\n2. Multiply 87 by 10 (the tens place digit of 14) = 870\nAnswer:\nNow, sum all the step results: 348 + 870 = 1218.\nSo, the final computed product is 1218.\n####\n# Question:\nWhat is the product of 112 and 889?\n# Reasoning:\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Multiply 112 by 9 (the ones place digit of 889) = 1008\n2. Multiply 112 by 80 (the tens place digit of 889) = 8960\n3. Multiply 112 by 800 (the hundreds place digit of 889) = 89600\nAnswer:",
