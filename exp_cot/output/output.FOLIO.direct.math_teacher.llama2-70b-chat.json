    "direct.math teacher_output": "The correct option is: B) False.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"If KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company's stock nor is its price volatile\" is false.\n\nWe know that KO is a mature company's stock, and mature companies' stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, KO cannot be a growth company's stock.\n\nAdditionally, we know that all growth companies' stocks are volatile, but we cannot conclude that KO's price is volatile just because it is a growth company's stock.

    "direct.math teacher_output": "The correct option is: B) False.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm\" is false. The context states that roses are given out on TV on Mondays at 8 pm on the Bachelor, which is a reality TV show. Breaking Bad, on the other hand, is not a reality TV show, but a scripted drama series. Therefore, it is not possible for roses to be given out on Breaking Bad on Monday at 8 pm.",

However, the premises do not support this conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that people who own a large desktop monitor at home work regularly and often at home. The second premise states that people with a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at home. These premises establish a connection between owning a large desktop monitor and working regularly at home, but they do not imply that people who work regularly at home cannot also spend their free time tidying and organizing their spaces.\n\nThe third premise states that people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.
